Tweet-Archive

A Python script to archive a user's tweets (including responses,
retweets, tweets responded to, etc.).

The Twitter API is used and tweets are stored in Twitter's XML format.
So far all it does is store them; I intend to add functionality to
transform the archived tweets into formats suitable for long-term
archiving.

Currently it archives these streams:

* user_timeline (your tweets) * mentions * retweets_of_me

For any tweet that is a response to another tweet (from any source), it
archives the original in a file called "references".

Dependencies: these Python modules are required:

* oauth2 * lxml

Installation:

First you must authorize the script to access your Twitter account using
OAuth. Follow the instructions in this tutorial:

Copy the properties file secrets.SAMPLE.properties to secrets.properties
and insert the values that were generated by the authentication process.
Make sure that secrets.properties is secure (e.g. "chmod go-r
secrets.properties").

Running:

Now run the script fetch-oauth2.py from the command line. It will create
a directory "output" and download XML files into it. The XML files are
timestamped e.g. "user_timeline_2011-01-16-112031.xml". A new properties
file ids.properties is also created containing the most recent tweet's
id in each stream. This is used in the next run to create "since_id"
parameters, to allow incremental updating.

Note: the script fetch-tweepy.py was a false start using Tweepy
